The cornerstones of the project are the connected battery solutions Mobi and the intelligence layer with modern asset management software. With that cities and partnering utilities can leverage the distributed emergency response equipment to tackle the biggest challenges in climate change and urbanization by setting up mobile microgrids on demand that supply power for communities and traffic and use as much renewable power as possible.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
